These are some of my programs I wrote as/for assignments.

- `cosmic-ray/`  
  contains 2 softwares.  
  `sim*.py`s roughly simulate how our detector detects cosmic rays coming through my school building. It tracks each rays, 
   calculates length passed through concretes, then kills rays randomly depends on the length.  
  `analysis.py` guesses the thickness of the building floors using data obtained in practice and simulated data.
  Hardcoded data is a fake, as I'm not sure that It can be public.

- `movie`  
  This is a software that takes music as a input and outputs movie. The assignment was to create software that output movie using openCL.  
  It draws simple fractals witch transforms depends on how the music is loud. And overlays spectrum of the music.   
  The output is below. I'm sorry that it's mess, because of gif compression.

- `resas`  
  contains 2 softwares.  
  One fetches poplations of engineers and patients from RESAS API.
  One examines If correlation exists between these poplations.

- `colors.ps`  
  This is handwritten PostScript program that draws this.
